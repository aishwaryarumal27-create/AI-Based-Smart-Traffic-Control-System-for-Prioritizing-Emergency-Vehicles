#  How It Works

1. Multiple traffic videos are processed simultaneously.
2. YOLOv8 detects vehicles in each frame.
3. Emergency vehicles are identified and prioritized.
4. Traffic signals dynamically change based on traffic conditions.
5. Live updates are sent to the frontend using WebSockets.
6. Dashboard displays:
   - Live camera feeds
   - Vehicle count
   - Signal state
   - ETA
   - Emergency alerts

---

# Emergency Vehicle Priority

When an emergency vehicle is detected:
- The corresponding lane signal turns GREEN
- Other lanes turn RED
- Signal timer updates instantly
- Emergency alert is displayed on dashboard
